# Programming-Assignment-3-Stacks
For this assignment I decided to use the Stack libarary in order to complete this assigment with ease. I know that using the libarary isn't the best option Space-wise since there is several functions that is not called from it. But For the sake of this project I will put that aside.

Seeing how the Stack portion of the project is already done. I just need to implement the IF statements so the stack can start stacking and the program can do what it is programmed to do.
